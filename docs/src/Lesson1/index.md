# Getting started

This file contains instructions for completing today's lesson.
It is written in a language called "markdown",
which allows plain text to be easily converted
into nicely formatted webpages like the one you're looking at now.
But we'll come back to this.

To complete this lesson, follow the instructions below.

!!! warning
    It is even more important than usual
    to read and follow instructions
    when it comes to computers and programming.
    We will be interacting with our computers
    using procedural language - that is,
    language that follows a strict set of procedures.
    Skipping steps or doing things out of order
    can lead to unexpected results.

    This is a test

## First steps

Most modern computer code is just text
that tells a computer what to do.
The part that is complicated is that code tends to be:

1. Literal - the computer can only do exactly what you specifically tell it;
   it won't try to guess your meaning
   and it doesn't understand nuance.
1. Procedural - you must provide **all** of the commands
   and you must provide them **in the correct order**

[Watch this video][exact-video] to get a sense of why this matters so much.

In this course,
we'll be primarily interacting with that computer code as plain text,
but there are a bunch of tools that people have built
to make that job a bit easier.

### Installing your IDE

One of those tools is an "Integrated Development Environment" or IDE.
This is basically just a text editor with a bunch of bells and whistles.
