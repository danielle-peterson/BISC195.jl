# ## Writing real Code
# 
# In assignments 1 and 2, variable and function names
# were often things like `question1` and `question2`.
# From now on, we'll use more informative function and variable names
# so that our code is "self documenting."
# 
# We'll also continue to use doc strings to help understand
# the specifications required for our functions.
